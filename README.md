# Computational Macroeconomics using Julia

This repo contains some codes to solve dynamic general equilibrium models.

If you find some mistakes or know the more efficient method, please let me know. 


Basically I have written codes using Julia version 0.6.4.

Now, I rewrite my codes using Julia version 1.0.0.
